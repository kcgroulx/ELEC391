## How to Contribute
Best software engineering practicies should be followed.  
If you want to implement a feature.

1. Create a user branch in git
```console
git checkout -b [your name]/[feature]
Example
git checkout - kyle/my_cool_feature
```
2. Commit directly to your new branch.
```console
git add .
git commit -m "Added things, fixed stuff"
```

3. Once ready, create a PR on Github, get other people to review. Then merge into `main`.
